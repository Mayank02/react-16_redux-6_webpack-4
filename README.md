# React-16*, Redux-6*, React-router-4 and Webpack-4*
Boilerplate to start the project using React 16*, Redux 4* and Webpack 4*.
A basic setup which take lot of time to start the project, tried to keep it simple and clean.

Contains: 

* ES6 - 7 Support with Babel
* Redux dev tools to help you keep track of the app's state
* React Routing
* hot module replacement support so you can change modules or react components without having to reload the browser
* a webpack production config so you can build the app and make it ready for production
* Sass support, just import your styles wherever you need them
* much more...


## Run the app

0. ```npm install```
0. ```npm start```

The app updates without the browser having to reload. You don't lose state!

## Build the app

This will build the app into the "dist" directory in the root of the project. It contains the index.html along with main.js and main.css.
